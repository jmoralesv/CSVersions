# RoslynAndYou
Demos and slides for Roslyn and language feature presentation.

The sample solutions currently requires Visual Studio 2017 (15.7) or above to include all of the C# versions and the Roslyn SDK. If you have earlier versions, you may need to exclude selected demos which earlier complier versions can not support. As the .Net Compiler Platform continues to evolve and new updates to Visual Studio ship, these samples may need to be updated to match the changes that come with those versions. 

I make no promise of keeping the demos up to date. Besides, I often find that Ilearn more by trying to fix bugs than just looking at functioning code anyway. If you find something out of date or have changes to recommend, this is open source. I welcome pull requests.
